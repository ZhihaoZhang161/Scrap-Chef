Scrap Chef - Web Application

Project Overview
Scrap Chef is a web application designed for users to post, rate, and review their "struggle meals." The application allows users to create an account, upload meals, and rate them based on taste, ease of preparation, and struggle level. It is built using Python, Django, HTML, CSS, and other associated technologies including JavaScript, AJAX, and JQuery.


Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Post Uploading: Users can upload posts with media (images/videos) and captions for their meals.
Meal Rating: Users can rate meals based on taste, struggle, and preparation time.
Meal Saving: Users can save their favorite posts to their profile.
Feed and Dashboard: A personalized dashboard to view and manage posts, as well as an aggregated feed of all posts with ratings.
Responsive Design: The interface is responsive and adjusts according to screen size for both mobile and desktop views.

Python 3.x
Django
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX
SQLite or PostgreSQL (for database)
Bootstrap (for responsive design)
